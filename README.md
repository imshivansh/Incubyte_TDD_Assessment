# Incubyte_TDD_Assessment
Please check out the master branch to review the code and observe how it evolved step by step according to the requirements. This branch provides a detailed view of the code development process, aligned with the specified criteria.

Overview
Welcome to Incubyte's Assessment, designed with the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology in mind. TDD is an approach to software development that emphasizes rigorous testing throughout the entire development process. It's not a framework, but rather a disciplined practice that helps you write clean, reliable code by integrating tests at every stage of development.

TDD Workflow
To practice effective TDD, follow these core principles:

1.Write a Test First
Start by writing a test for the functionality you want to implement, even before writing the actual code.

2.Run the Test and Watch It Fail
Run the newly written test to confirm that it fails, proving that the functionality you’re about to build doesn’t exist yet.

3.Write the Minimum Code to Pass the Test
Implement the simplest, most minimal code needed to make the test pass.

4.Run All Tests to Confirm Success
Run your full test suite to ensure all tests pass, verifying that your new code works and hasn’t broken any existing functionality.

5.Refactor the Code
Clean up your code, improving its structure and readability without changing its behavior. Keep the code efficient and maintainable.

6.Repeat the Process
Continuously repeat these steps for each new feature or bug fix.

By following these principles, you ensure a high-quality, reliable, and maintainable codebase.
